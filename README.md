# fMRIFlows

All of this is still under heavy development and a proper README will follow. But first, I want to clearly point out that this repo was inspired by [fmriprep](https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep). And so it should come with no surprise that many similarities can be found.


# Feedback, Help & Support

If you want to help with this project or have any questions, fell free to fork the repo and send us a pull requeest. If you have any questions or found a problem, open a new [issue on github](https://github.com/miykael/fmriflows/issues).


# Thanks and Acknowledgment

I would like to thank Peer Heerh... What? I spoke to long and have to leave the stage?
